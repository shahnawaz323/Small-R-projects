# Small-R-projects

* This repo contains the small projects I do with my free lance clients online.
* These are all paid projects done in less than 2 days by me.
* Occasional revisions are also included
* Sometimes the file read in `read_csv` is not provided in project folder which is due to large size of file. File can be given on demand or I will provide a link to download in csv underneath the code chunk
